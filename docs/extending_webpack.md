title: Extending Webpack

You can also extend the underlying webpack config. Create a file called `razzle.config.js` in your project's root.

```js
// razzle.config.js

module.exports = {
  modify: (config, { target, dev }, webpack) => {
    // do something to config

    return config;
  },
};
```

A word of advice: `razzle.config.js` is an escape hatch. However, since it's just JavaScript, you can and should publish your `modify` function to npm to make it reusable across your projects. For example, imagine you added some custom webpack loaders and published it as a package to npm as `my-razzle-modifictions`. You could then write your `razzle.config.js` like so:

```
// razzle.config.js
const modify = require('my-razzle-modifictions');

module.exports = {
  modify
}
```

Last but not least, if you find yourself needing a more customized setup, Razzle is _very_ forkable. There is one webpack configuration factory that is 300 lines of code, and 4 scripts (`build`, `start`, `test`, and `init`). The paths setup is shamelessly taken from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and the rest of the code related to logging.
