Razzle comes with most of ES6 stuff you need. However, if you want to add your own babel transformations, just add a `.babelrc` file to the root of your project.

```js
{
  "presets": [
    "razzle/babel", // NEEDED
    "stage-0"
   ],
   "plugins": [
     // additional plugins
   ]
}
```

A word of advice: the `.babelrc` file will replace the internal razzle babelrc template. You must include at the very minimum the default razzle/babel preset.
